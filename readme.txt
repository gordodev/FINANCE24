SECURE COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN A LAN

==================================

Updated Communication Protocols
TCP with SSL/TLS:
For secure communication without the overhead of HTTPS.

Direct TCP/IP:
If security is managed at the network level (e.g., VPN, firewalls).

Frontend to Backend:
Using TCP with SSL/TLS for secure communication within the LAN.

Backend to Market Data Feed:
TCP/IP.

Backend to Position Server:
Using TCP with SSL/TLS for secure communication within the LAN.

Position Server to Database:
SQL over a secure connection if required.

DETAILED COMPONENTS AND DATA FLOW WITH UPDATED PROTOCOLS

Windows Frontend Application
User Interaction:
Trader places a buy/sell order.

Data Transmission:
Order details (e.g., symbol, quantity, price) sent to the Trading Backend via TCP with SSL/TLS.

Linux Trading Backend Service
Receive Order:
Backend receives the trade order.

Process Order:
Validates the order and interacts with the market data feed to execute the trade.

Update Position:
Sends the trade details to the Position Server via TCP with SSL/TLS.

Linux Position Server
Receive Trade Details:
Position server receives trade details.

Update Database:
Updates the positions in the database based on the trade.

Acknowledge Update:
Sends a confirmation back to the Trading Backend.

Database
Positions Table:
Stores the current positions of traders.

Trades Table:
Logs each trade executed.

Market Data Feed
Real-Time Data:
Provides live market data (e.g., prices, volumes) via TCP/IP.

Data Integration:
Trading Backend uses this data to execute trades at market prices.

Application Logs
Logging Events:
All significant events (e.g., order received, trade executed, position updated) are logged.

Storage:
Logs can be stored in files or centralized logging services (e.g., ELK stack).

UPDATED COMMUNICATION PATHS

Windows Frontend to Linux Backend (TCP with SSL/TLS)
Order Placement:
Direction: Windows Frontend -> Linux Backend
Protocol: TCP with SSL/TLS (for secure LAN transmission)
Data: Trade order details (symbol, quantity, price)

Linux Backend to Market Data Feed (TCP/IP)
Market Data Fetch:
Direction: Linux Backend <-> Market Data Feed
Protocol: TCP/IP
Data: Real-time market prices and volumes

Linux Backend to Linux Position Server (TCP with SSL/TLS)
Trade Execution Details:
Direction: Linux Backend -> Linux Position Server
Protocol: TCP with SSL/TLS (for secure LAN transmission)
Data: Trade details (trader_id, symbol, trade_type, quantity, price)

Position Server to Database (SQL)
Position and Trade Logging:
Direction: Linux Position Server -> Database
Protocol: SQL (Database connection)
Data: Position updates and trade logs

Application Logs
Event Logging:
Direction: All components -> Logging Service/Files
Protocol: Depends on logging implementation (e.g., file I/O, network logging services)
Data: Events, errors, and debug information
